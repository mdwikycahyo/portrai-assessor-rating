└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**User Mindset**: "Does AI's assessment align with my observations?"  
**Decision Process**:
1. Read AI reasoning carefully
2. Mental cross-check against reviewed evidence
3. Consider if AI missed any nuances
4. Decide whether to accept or override recommendation

#### **Step 3.2: Professional Judgment Application**
**Scenario A: Agreement with AI**
- **Action**: Accept AI recommendation
- **Focus**: Craft detailed assessor notes explaining agreement
- **Example Notes**: "Participant showed strong analytical skills and proactive stakeholder engagement. The systematic approach to data gathering supports the Meet Requirement rating. Could improve by documenting decision criteria more explicitly."

**Scenario B: Disagreement with AI**
- **Action**: Override AI recommendation using dropdown
- **Options**: Change to Strength or Need Improvement
- **Focus**: Detailed rationale for override decision
- **Example Override**: Change to "Strength" based on exceptional stakeholder collaboration

#### **Step 3.3: Rationale Documentation**
**Action**: Complete mandatory assessor notes  
**Requirements**: Specific evidence, professional judgment, improvement areas  
**Quality Standards**: Clear, defensible, actionable feedback

**Example Complete Notes**:
```
"Participant demonstrated excellent systematic approach to complex decision-making. 
Strengths include prompt response to stakeholders (replied within minutes), 
thorough data analysis (12+ minutes on financial documents), and proactive 
collaboration (initiated stakeholder calls). The quality of written communication 
was professional and showed strategic thinking. Areas for development include 
more explicit documentation of decision criteria and risk assessment frameworks. 
Overall performance meets requirements with strong collaborative tendencies."
```
